# AdventureGame
This is my final project for my intro course on C#. This project was an exploration of the power of object oriented programming concepts, and took advantage of C#'s delegates/lambdas.
I want to credit my professor Chip Anderson for the idea to do this project, and for setting up the general framework. The original contributions I made include: the salesman, potions, and player classes.
